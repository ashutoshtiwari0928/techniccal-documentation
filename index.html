                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).

                <li>
                    Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");   
            </code>
            <p>
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <article>You can declare a variable in three ways:
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,
            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            By simply assigning it a value. For example.</p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                <code>x = 42.</code>
                This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                
                With the keyword let. For example,
                <code>let y = 13.</code>
                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

            <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
            </p>
            <p> 
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="constants">

            <article>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>
                <code>
                    const PI = 3.14;
                </code>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.


                </p>
                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
//statements }
                </code>
                <p>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
                </p>
                <code>
                    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
"otherValue";  
                </code>
